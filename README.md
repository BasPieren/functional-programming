## To Do 📌
This is a list of things in want to do in this project.
- [ ] Git, npm, and d3 are used; the project runs without errors; data is loaded with d3; there is a representation of data.
- [ ] Data is rendered with d3; interpreting the representation is easier that interpreting the data itself.
- [ ] d3 is used to clean data and make a dynamic representation;data is functionally transformed.
- [ ] Representation and use of d3 go beyond an example: there are demonstrable additions like a well-chosen scale.
- [ ] Changes persist across page reloads.
- [ ] The way the student applies subject matter is more advanced than what they were taught in class; let’s switch places.
